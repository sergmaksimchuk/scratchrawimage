# Scratch RawImage plugin for Unity3d

Great solution if you would like to add scratch effect on your project

The plugin was based on [that thread](http://stackoverflow.com/a/23366233/5976147) thanks Sergey Krusch for that

To see how it works check [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ANDYPANDY.Instant21&hl=uk) project

### Future improvements 
* Get rid the Camera object
*  Check persentage of scratched area
